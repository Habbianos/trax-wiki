# Trax Wiki

Welcome to the official content repository for [Traxmachine Wiki](https://traxmachine.com)!  
This repo contains structured, community-curated content used by the Traxmachine platform.

Whether you're a DJ, music lover, or contributor, you're welcome to add, edit, or improve content through pull requests.

## What's inside

All content is stored as human-readable Markdown, YAML or TOML files under the `content/` folder. Each subfolder represents a different collection, such as:

- `timeline-events/`: relevant events that happened over the years
- `packs-page/`: Trax packs released
- `samples-infobox/`: estructured data about each sample

> More collections will be added over time.

## Usage

The file `content/schema.ts` defines the structure and validation rules for the collections, following the `zod` syntax.

## How to contribute
